# Slack Survey Dashboard

This project contains an interactive IBM Cognos Analytics dashboard built from the Slack Survey dataset. The dashboard provides insights into current and future technology trends as well as respondent demographics.

## 📊 Dashboard Overview

The dashboard is organized into **three main tabs:**

1. **Current Technology Usage**
   - Top programming languages, databases, web frameworks, and platforms respondents are currently using.
   
2. **Future Technology Trends**
   - Technologies respondents want to learn or use in the future, including desired programming languages, databases, platforms, and web frameworks.
   
3. **Demographics**
   - Distribution of respondents by country, age, and formal education levels.
   - Breakdown of age groups by education level.
